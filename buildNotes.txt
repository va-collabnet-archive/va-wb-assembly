Build notes (for our massive mess)

Normal build process - first download - initial sync.
From elsewhere, copy the "Changesets for WF Cleanup hack\WF_Setup" folder into the database\profiles\src\main\profiles\ folder 
(creating the WF_Setup folder there.)

Push this change up, and then sync it down in the WB you have from the first part of the normal build process.

In the WB, go to  Project Manager -> Maintenance Worklist (bottom of the Project tree) -> roles -> edit roles -> fill -> save

Synchronize

From elsewhere, copy the "Changesets for WF Cleanup hack\WF_Work" folder into the database\profiles\src\main\profiles\ folder 
(creating the WF_Work folder there)

Push this change up.

Rebuild the installation package (which will process all of the changesets, and build them into the DB)

Test - hopefully - the build is good at this point.
